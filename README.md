## Description
  This project was a build from scracth project using MongoDB and Mongoose. This was my first project using Mongoose and I find it much simpler to work with than MySQL. I used different methods on my models for learning purposes, and I tried to use comments as much as possible to explain what I needed to do before I built it. I have been struggling with getting the reactions and friends routes working properly. The friends create route only works correctly when a new user is created while adding a friend. Then the fiend count increases and the friend _id is added to the friends: virtual. However I am still unable to delete a friend. The reaction routes are both working properly.
  The User and Thought routes area all working properly.And I am able to create, update, and delete a single user, as well as, retrieve a list of all users. The thought routes can create, update, and delete a single, and return all thoughts.

## Installation
  Entering npm start in the CLI will spin up the server and a prompt will be displayed in the terminal stating "API server running on port 3001!". From there the user can interact with the server on Insomnia.


## Future Development
  I would like to get the friends routes working without having to create a user when adding a friend. It should just add an id to the friends: array and increase the friends count without requiring a new user to be created.
