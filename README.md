# challenge-18-nosql-awy



## Description
  This project was a build from scracth project using MongoDB and Mongoose. This was my first project using Mongoose and I find it much simpler to work with than MySQL. I used different methods on my models for learning purposes, and I tried to use comments as much as possible to explain what I needed to do before I built it. I have been struggling with getting the reactions and friends routes working properly. The friends create route only works correctly when a new user is created while adding a friend. Then the fiend count increases and the friend _id is added to the friends: virtual. Also, I was able to add a reaction but not remove a reaction. Now I can remove a reaction but not add a reaction. I am getting a 200 wrong route response so I know I am close. All of the User and Thought routes function properly.

## Installation
  Entering node index.js in the CLI will spin up the server and a prompt will be displayed in the terminal stating "API server running on port 3001!". From there the user can interact with the server on Insomnia.


## Future Development
  I would like to get the reaction routes working correctly and the friends routes working without having to create a user when adding a friend. It should just add an id to the friends: array and increase the friends count without requiring a new user to be created.
