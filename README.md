## Description
  This project was a build from scracth project using MongoDB and Mongoose. This was my first project using Mongoose and I find it much simpler to work with than MySQL. I used different methods on my models for learning purposes, and I tried to use comments as much as possible to explain what I needed to do before I built it. I have been struggling with getting the reactions and friends routes working properly. The friends create route only works correctly when a new user is created while adding a friend. Then the fiend count and add friend_id works.
